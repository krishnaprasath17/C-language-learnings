# C (small demo)

This repository contains two small C files:

- `hi.c` — prints a message
- `this.c` — prints "hi"

How to build (with MinGW/GCC on Windows):

```powershell
gcc hi.c -o hi.exe
gcc this.c -o this.exe
./hi.exe
./this.exe
```

This README was copied into the `c/` folder so the project is grouped under `c/` as requested.
